### What I learned

Through building a responsive price grid using HTML, CSS Flexbox, Grid, and media queries, I have learned how to create a flexible layout that adapts to different screen sizes. Flexbox allowed me to control the alignment and distribution of elements within the grid, while CSS Grid enabled precise control over the grid structure. Media queries helped me adjust the layout for different screen widths, ensuring a smooth user experience across devices. This project enhanced my understanding of responsive design principles and how to combine various CSS techniques to achieve a functional, visually appealing layout.

### Continued development

To continue improving the media query and responsive behavior of my site, I plan to refine the breakpoints to ensure a seamless experience across a broader range of devices, especially smaller screens and high-resolution displays. I'll also focus on optimizing the layout by fine-tuning the flexbox and grid properties, ensuring elements are proportionally sized and well-aligned as the screen size changes. Additionally, I intend to test the performance of the responsive design on various devices and browsers, making adjustments where necessary to enhance accessibility and load times. By incorporating advanced CSS features like minmax() in Grid or experimenting with container queries, I aim to further elevate the flexibility and adaptability of the design.
